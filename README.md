# Introduction to Structural Design Patterns
1. Structural Design Patterns focus on how classes and objects are put together to form 
larger structures, simplifying the complex systems.
2. There are two categories: class patterns (concerned with "is a" relationships and inheritance
) and object patterns (concerned with "has a" relationships and object behaviour).
3. Class patterns use interfaces to define shared functionality, while object patterns allow
changing the behaviour of individual objects at runtime
