Implementation of Design Patterns in Java

# Introduction to Structural Design Patterns
1. Structural Design Patterns focus on how classes and objects are put together to form 
larger structures, simplifying the complex systems.
2. There are two categories: class patterns (concerned with "is a" relationships and inheritance
) and object patterns (concerned with "has a" relationships and object behaviour).
3. Class patterns use interfaces to define shared functionality, while object patterns allow
changing the behaviour of individual objects at runtime

# Understand the Adapter Design Pattern
1. The Adapter pattern allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work
together, similar to how a plug adapter works.
2. It is often used with existing code to avoid changes that might break 
functionality or when dealing with third-party libraries.
3. There are two types of Adapter Patterns: Class Version(Uses Inheritance)
and object version(Uses composition). The object version is more common in
java due to its support for single inheritance.
